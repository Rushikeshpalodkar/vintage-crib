# 🔌 How to Disconnect Render Deployment from eBay

## 🎯 Goal
Disconnect your live Render website from eBay API and stop all external syncing.

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1: Access Render Dashboard**

1. Go to **https://dashboard.render.com**
2. Sign in with your account
3. Find your **vintage-crib** web service
4. Click on it to open the service dashboard

---

### **Step 2: Remove/Update Environment Variables**

In your Render service dashboard:

1. Click on **"Environment"** in the left sidebar
2. Find and **DELETE** these variables (or set them to empty):
   - `EBAY_APP_ID` → DELETE or set to empty
   - `EBAY_CERT_ID` → DELETE or set to empty
   - `EBAY_DEV_ID` → DELETE or set to empty

3. **ADD** a new environment variable:
   - **Key**: `LOCAL_MODE`
   - **Value**: `true`

4. Click **"Save Changes"**

---

### **Step 3: Update sync-settings.json**

Your git repository already has the updated `data/sync-settings.json` with:
```json
{
  "autoSyncEnabled": false
}
```

This will be deployed when Render rebuilds.

---

### **Step 4: Trigger Manual Deploy**

After updating environment variables:

1. Go to the **"Manual Deploy"** section
2. Click **"Deploy latest commit"**
3. Or click **"Clear build cache & deploy"** (recommended)

This will redeploy your app with:
- ✅ No eBay credentials
- ✅ LOCAL_MODE enabled
- ✅ Auto-sync disabled

---

### **Step 5: Verify Deployment**

Once deployment completes (2-5 minutes):

1. Check the **Logs** tab in Render
2. Look for these messages:
   - `⚠️ eBay API credentials not found - running in demo mode`
   - `🔑 eBay Client ID configured: false`
   - `⏸️ Auto-sync is disabled`

3. Visit your live website
4. Check that it's working but NOT fetching from eBay

---

## ✅ Expected Results

After following these steps, your Render deployment will:

- ❌ **NOT** connect to eBay API
- ❌ **NOT** run auto-sync every 90 minutes
- ❌ **NOT** fetch new products from eBay
- ✅ **WILL** serve existing 136 products from database
- ✅ **WILL** work locally with no external connections

---

## 🔍 How to Verify It Worked

### **Check Render Logs:**
```
⚠️ eBay API credentials not found - running in demo mode
🔑 eBay Client ID configured: false
⏸️ Auto-sync is disabled
```

### **Check Your Website:**
- Products still display (from local database)
- No new products appear
- No sync activity in admin dashboard

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Database Stays Intact**: Your 136 existing products will remain
2. **Images Still Load**: Product images still reference eBay CDN (need internet)
3. **Admin Works**: Admin dashboard continues to function locally
4. **No New Data**: Won't fetch any new products or updates

---

## 🔄 To Re-Enable Later (If Needed)

If you want to reconnect to eBay in the future:

1. Go back to Render Environment Variables
2. Add back:
   - `EBAY_APP_ID=<your-credentials>`
   - `EBAY_CERT_ID=<your-credentials>`
   - `EBAY_DEV_ID=<your-credentials>`
3. Set `LOCAL_MODE=false`
4. Update `data/sync-settings.json` to `"autoSyncEnabled": true`
5. Commit and push to git
6. Render will auto-deploy

## 📞 Support

If you have any issues:
